# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Accelerometer-Data
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has a
wide range of applications due to the widespread usage
of acquisition devices such as smartphones and its ability
to capture human activity data. The ability to retrieve
deeply embedded information for precise detection and its
interpretation has been transformed by breakthroughs in
Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, the time series
dataset, acquired from Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab
(WISDM) Lab, is used to extract features of common
human activities from a raw signal data of smartphone
accelerometer. A 2D convolutional neural network is used
to visualize the data.
